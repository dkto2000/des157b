  <h1>Usability Results</h1>
  <p>When user testing with Steve, he mentioned how my book lacked enough content. He said that the experience was too short as there really is only two pages of interaction in the book. He suggested that I should at least do two to three more pages of interaction and that I should changed it up with different interactive behaviors such as scrolling, and clicking instead of hover. I have looked into chart.js to add more statistics to interact with. </p>
  <p>Steve also mentioned that there should be a source page or section for my website since that was missing from user test. I agree that there should be one since I need to credit all of the libraries I used for the site. I will work on that in the next version.</p>
  <p>My usage of fonts were also mentioned as Steve found them a little basic and hard to read. He said I should make the fonts more legible especially since I am making a book format which is heavily text based. I agree with this sentiment as well because last time users could not see my descriptions or instructions to the scripted interactions. I will look into fonts to incoroporate after this.
