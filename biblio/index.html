      <p class="content">This article talks about the aging infrastructure of the United States through the analysis of it's roads, railways, electrical grids, and internet providers, leading to delays, rising maintenance costs, and safety risks. This is related to the subject matter I am researching (American Exceptionalism dystopia) because the article lists down current downward trends involving the infrastructure of the United States that help shape the image of a dystopia in which our standard of living is considered laughable compared to the rest of the world. Despite this, the authors concludes the article by expressing how there is still hope in fixing our infrastructure through possible future investment by the US government but also cautions not to expect much change in the nearby future.

      <p class="content">This article provides data of how efficient each component of the US' current infrastructure is compared to other parts of the world. It also gives the readers some insight on the funding history of each section of infrastructure weaving together a history of how a specific component got from point A to point B. This is related to the subject matter I am researching (American Exceptionalism dystopia) because the article has viable data to draw from that empirically illustrates how dire the current situation regarding the infrastructureof the US is and the article also sheds light on what positive trends are emerging in other places in the world as well.

      <p class="content">
        The article discusses the start of what's termed as America's "infrastructure decade," analyzing how macroeconomic factors might influence local strategies. It highlights the significant federal investment in infrastructure through bills like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), totaling $1.25 trillion. However, challenges such as price inflation in the construction sector, rising municipal debt costs, a tight labor market, and declining state and local government revenues could hinder efficient implementation.  This is related to the subject matter I am researching (American Exceptionalism dystopia) because the article discusses the current day challenges that American infrastructure is facing. With this data, I can make my dystopia more belivable by playing into at least one of these hurdles as the main causes for dystopia.
