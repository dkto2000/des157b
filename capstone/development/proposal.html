  <h1>Capstone Proposal</h1>
  <p>The topic I want to focus on is how the build quality of certain products in the US have degraded in quality over time. I wan to to display this by going over the materials being used for the item presently versus in the past. For instance, the common fridge currently uses plastic as a central material for molding it's trays while back then in the 1950s, metals such as Aluminium was more often used. My target audience would likely be very broad but I would like to at least target people from my generation as many of us have not been exposed to the quality builds of yore. I plan to work with Steve Wu for this endeavor. My topic will focus on challenging mental models because this website will challenge the idea of things being modern being associated with refined and advanced. Some features I'd like to include is an interactive jpeg that allows you to split the item apart so that users can view the individual materials being used. The concern for my site is that the website might come off as too factual.</p>
